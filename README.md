#### Execution

Each script can be run from the command line or from within R using the 
source command.

The very first script is "TPC_fitting_pipeline.R" and it needs the [data](https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.24106161.v1)
to be placed under a "Data/" directory, outside "Code/". It also needs 
the "Results/model_fits/" directory to exist.
